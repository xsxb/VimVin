The aim of this AutoHotkey script is to provide an out-of-the-box, vimified experience
for common Windows applications. This tool is planned to be modular for ease of configuration
and extensability.

For web browsing I recommend using the [Vimium browser extension](https://vimium.github.io/).

## Planned Features

- Windows Notepad
- Notepad++
- Windows Explorer
- MS Excel
- MS Word
- Windows Calculator
- CLI mode
